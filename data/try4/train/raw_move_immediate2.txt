         MVI  D1(B1),I2


Move immediate (MVI) is used to store a one-byte immediate constant
to a field in storage.  Operand 1 denotes the target in main storage,
while operand 2 is coded as a self-defining term which is placed
in the instruction.

As an example, consider the following code,
 
         MVI  FIELDA,X'C1'
       ...
FIELDA   DC   X'123456'

This will place the value X'C1' in the first byte of FIELDA, with
the result being

FIELDA   DC   X'C13456'
