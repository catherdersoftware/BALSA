PROMPT

Write code in BAL Assembly to add two signed fullword values, where one value is in memory and the other value is in a register.   
Store the result in memory with a field name of RESULT.  

Assume the values to add are originally in memory at field name VAL1 and VAL2.

Show how the field names should be declared.
