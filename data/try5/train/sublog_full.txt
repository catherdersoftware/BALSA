PROMPT

Write some code in BAL Assembly to subtract an unsigned fullword integer in storage from a register and store the result in memory with a field name of DIFF.

Assume the register R1 already contains the subtrahend, and the fullword FIELD contains the minuend.

Use `*` to identify a comment and obey column restrictions for the code.

Do not show any subroutine standard entry and exit code.

Show how the field name should be declared.
