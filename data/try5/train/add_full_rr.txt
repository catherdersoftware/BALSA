RESULT

```
         AR   R1,R2
         ST   R1,RESULT 


RESULT   DC   F'0'
```

The format of the required instruction is:

Machine Format

| OpCode | R1 | R2 |
|:-------|:---|:---|
| 1A     | X  | X  |

Assembler Format

```
         OpCode R1,R2
```

Add signed value in register R2 to value in register R1.  

## condition code

* comparison


PROMPT

Write code in BAL Assembly to add two signed fullword registers and store the result in memory with a field name of RESULT.  

Assume the values to add are already in registers R1 and R2.

Show how the field name should be declared.  Explan what condition code flags are modified.
